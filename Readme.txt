Data Statement
The product datasets used in this study are detailed in the "Data acquisition and processing" section of this paper. This document presents only the resultant data obtained after processing and re-analysis of the above datasets.

Data Content
Mask.tif. The baseline raster used for mask extraction of the Northern Slope Economic Belt of Tianshan Mountains source area data in the product dataset, stored in the "Mask" folder.
Land Use Data. Includes land use data for 2000, 2010 and 2020. The dataset processed by Reclassify by primary classification after mask extraction using mask data (converted by secondary classification system, the converted data contains 6 land types and is stored in the folder "Reclassify_And_Extract_by_mask" under the directory "Land Use Data"). Reclassify_And_Extract_by_mask" folder).
Variation rates of annual precipitation and temperature. These data are derived from the base dataset of meteorological data calculated by the "Raster Calculator" tool. C1 is the annual precipitation variation rate and C2 is the annual temperature variation rate, which are stored in the "variation rates" folder.
Shannon's diversity index. The study area was divided into several grid cells of 5km*5km size and the Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) was obtained by calculating the land use raster data within each cell by Fragstats 4.2 software, which included three time cut-off points. The data were stored in the "SHDI" folder.
Ecosystem Resilience. Includes data for three time cutoffs: 2000, 2010 and 2020. Stored in the "ER" folder.
Land-use transition. Data on land-use changes in the study area during the first and second decades obtained by applying the Geo-informatic Tupu method. The VALUE of these raster data is the number corresponding to the land use type. Further, raster data of Cropland and Urban Expansion were extracted from them by attributes respectively. These data are stored in the folder "Geo-informatic Tupu".
Standard deviation ellipse. This section contains the vector data of the Standard deviation ellipse (SDE_year.shp) of the ER at the three time cutoffs and its corresponding distribution center (DC_year.shp), which is stored in the "Standard deviation ellipse" folder.
Geographic Scope: The source of the NSEBTM (79◦53′E ~ 96◦23′E, 40◦52′N ~ 47◦14′N).
Temporal Scope: 2000 to 2020.
